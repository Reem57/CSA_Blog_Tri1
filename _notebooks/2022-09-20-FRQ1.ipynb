    "Write the simulate method, which simulates the frog attempting to hop in a straight line to a goal from the frog's starting position of 0 within a maximum number of hops. The method returns true if the frog successfully reached the goal within the maximum number of hops; otherwise, the method returns false. The FrogSimulation class provides a method called hopDistance that returns an integer representing the distance (positive or negative) to be moved when the frog hops. A positive distance represents a move toward the goal. A negative distance represents a move away from the goal. The returned distance may vary from call to call. Each time the frog hops, its position is adjusted by the value returned by\n",
