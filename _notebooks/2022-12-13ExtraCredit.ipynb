    "Both of today's presenters did not have a great plan after graduation, but they were able to pivot and be successful in their own ways. As a result, I should be prepared to not always follow Plan A and to be resilient in life. In addition, I learnt to be adaptable and to plan ahead of time. For example, attempt to forecast how your company's future will look and be as adaptable as possible to new environments/jobs. Some critical talents in the business include the ability to listen to and comprehend the company's needs and translate them into a solution that can be executed in the high-tech industry. There are numerous examples of computer software assisting other sectors by utilizing the logic you learn with it, which is why learning computer science is crucial for even non-computer related industries."
